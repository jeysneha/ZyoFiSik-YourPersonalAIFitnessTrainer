# About the Project
The main goal of our project is to develop an interactive web application that has three main modules, namely The Yoga Assistant module, The Exercise Trainer module, and The Meditation Module.

The Yoga Assistant module uses a webcam to recognize the user's yoga and exercise poses and estimates each pose to assist the user practicing those postures to infer whether or not practiced effectively. In the Meditation Module the user specifies the duration of the meditation. The module provides meditation commands for the time set by the user.
